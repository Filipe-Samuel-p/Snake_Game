One of the coolest projects I had the opportunity to develop was the famous Snake Game (or snake game, for those who are more intimate) in Python.

I wanted to consolidate my knowledge in #Python with a basic game and I immediately remembered this one. Although using the #Pygame library would perhaps be easier, I opted for a more challenging and fun approach using the Turtle library.

The Turtle library allows you to create graphical results, enabling the execution of various functions. The idea is simple: a turtle with a pen "on its back" moves and "paints" the screen. Although it is a basic library, it is extremely efficient. The most interesting thing is that when developing this game, the programmer fixes many concepts of programming logic and mainly delves into object-oriented programming, which is fundamental for this type of project.
